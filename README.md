Click [here](https://protected-refuge-42670.herokuapp.com/teams) to check it out!

This web application simulates an entire baseball season with 30 teams, down to each individual pitch. Right now, the application has the following features:

- Teams compete in divisions and leagues, just like the MLB.
- Teams lineups and positions can be edited by the team owner.
- Full play-by-play, down to each individual pitch, is generated for each game.
- Full box score can be viewed for every game.
- League leaders page shows the top 10 players in different offensive and defensive categories.
- Full player and team stats are easily accessible.
- Realistic team schedules are generated, taking into account 2-, 3-, and 4- game series and interleague play.
- Players have randomly generated attributes that represent skills in different areas.

**But wait, isn't this a lot like [CSFBL](http://www.csfbl.com/home)?***

Yes, it is! I played CSFBL (Computer Simulated Fantasy Baseball League) for many years and that is what inspired me to try to build my own baseball simulation program. My application is not a commercial product and I am not trying to compete with CSFBL or any other baseball simulation application. I simply started this project as a challenge to see how far I could take this idea myself.

**Ideas for future improvement**

* Playoffs and World Series
* Awards and achievements
  * MVP
  * Cy Young
  * Rookie of the Year
  * Gold Glove
* Multiple seasons
* Automatically generated summaries for games, highlights of week, month, and season. 
* Trades
* Free agents
* Social media structure for user pages to facilitate discussion, trade proposals, etc.
