Before a pitcher throws a pitch, only three properties must be determined:

1. What type of pitch will the pitcher throw?
2. In what location will the pitcher try to throw it?
3. How fast will the pitcher try to throw it?

The pitcher will always try to put as much movement on each pitch as possible (because
pitches with more movement are always harder to hit), but different pitches will have
different maximum movement amounts.

After the pitcher throws the pitch, three additional properties must be determined:

1. In what location did the pitcher actually throw the pitch?
2. How fast did the pitcher actually throw the pitch?
3. How much movement did the pitcher put on the pitch?

We will assume that the pitcher will always successfully throw the pitch they were
trying to throw, since in real life no pitcher tries to throw a fastball and accidentally
throws a curveball, for example.

After the pitcher throws the pitch, but before it reaches the batter, a single property must first be determined:

1. Is the batter going to try to swing at this pitch?

What happens next depends on whether the batter tries to swing at the pitch. If the
batter swings at the pitch, then the next calculation is:

1. Did the batter make contact with the pitch?

If the batter did not swing, then the next calculation is:

1. Did the umpire call the pitch a strike?
